# Diabetes Prediction

## Description
The Diabetes Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the presence or absence of diabetes in individuals based on various clinical features. The project utilizes a dataset containing information such as glucose levels, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), age, and other factors related to diabetes.

## Installation
To run the code and reproduce the results, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage
To execute the code, open the project in your Python environment and run the main script or individual code sections.

## Data Preprocessing
The first step in the data analysis process is to clean and prepare the dataset for further analysis. The following code segment performs data cleaning tasks:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import warnings

warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

df = pd.read_csv("C:\\Users\\User\Desktop\\project data mininge\diabetes.csv")
df.head()

df.columns #learning about the columns

df.info()
#Print a concise summary of a DataFrame.
#This method prints information about a DataFrame including the index dtype and columns, non-null values and memory usage.

df.describe()
#helps us to understand how data has been spread across the table.
# count :- the number of NoN-empty rows in a feature.
# mean :- mean value of that feature.
# std :- Standard Deviation Value of that feature.
# min :- minimum value of that feature.
# max :- maximum value of that feature.
# 25%, 50%, and 75% are the percentile/quartile of each features.
