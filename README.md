# Diabetes Prediction

## Description
The Diabetes Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the presence or absence of diabetes in individuals based on various clinical features. The project utilizes a dataset containing information such as glucose levels, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), age, and other factors related to diabetes.

## Installation
To run the code and reproduce the results, follow these steps:
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage
To execute the code, open the project in your Python environment and run the main script or individual code sections.

## Data Preprocessing
The first step in the data analysis process is to clean and prepare the dataset for further analysis. The following code segment performs data cleaning tasks:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import warnings

warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

df = pd.read_csv("C:\\Users\\User\Desktop\\project data mininge\diabetes.csv")
df.head()

df.columns #learning about the columns

df.info()
#Print a concise summary of a DataFrame.
#This method prints information about a DataFrame including the index dtype and columns, non-null values and memory usage.

df.describe()
#helps us to understand how data has been spread across the table.
# count :- the number of NoN-empty rows in a feature.
# mean :- mean value of that feature.
# std :- Standard Deviation Value of that feature.
# min :- minimum value of that feature.
# max :- maximum value of that feature.
# 25%, 50%, and 75% are the percentile/quartile of each features.
```

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is an essential step in preparing the dataset for analysis and modeling. The following data cleaning tasks are performed:

- Dropping Duplicates:
```python
df = df.drop_duplicates()
df.isnull().sum()

print(df[df['BloodPressure']==0].shape[0])
print(df[df['Glucose']==0].shape[0])
print(df[df['SkinThickness']==0].shape[0])
print(df[df['Insulin']==0].shape[0])
print(df[df['BMI']==0].shape[0])
#checking for 0 values in 5 columns , 
#Age & DiabetesPedigreeFunction do not have have minimum 0 value so no need to replace ,
#also no. of pregnancies as 0 is possible as observed in df.describe
```


Certainly! Here's an updated section for the README file that includes the code for generating histograms for each feature:

## Data Cleaning
Data cleaning is an essential step in preparing the dataset for analysis and modeling. The following data cleaning tasks are performed:

- Dropping Duplicates:
```python
df = df.drop_duplicates()
The code removes any duplicate rows from the dataset, ensuring that each record is unique and preventing redundant information from affecting the analysis.

Handling Missing Values:
python
Copy code
df.isnull().sum()
The code checks for missing values in the dataset and prints the sum of missing values for each column. This step helps identify columns with missing data, which can then be handled appropriately, such as through imputation or removal of missing values.
```
## Data Visualization
To gain a better understanding of the distribution of each feature in the dataset, histograms are generated. This provides insights into the data range and helps identify any potential outliers or patterns.
```python
#histogram for each  feature
df.hist(bins=10,figsize=(10,10))

plt.show()
plt.figure(figsize=(16,12))
sns.set_style(style='whitegrid')
plt.subplot(3,3,1)
sns.boxplot(x='Glucose',data=df)
plt.subplot(3,3,2)
sns.boxplot(x='BloodPressure',data=df)
plt.subplot(3,3,3)
sns.boxplot(x='Insulin',data=df)
plt.subplot(3,3,4)
sns.boxplot(x='BMI',data=df)
plt.subplot(3,3,5)
sns.boxplot(x='Age',data=df)
plt.subplot(3,3,6)
sns.boxplot(x='SkinThickness',data=df)
plt.subplot(3,3,7)
sns.boxplot(x='Pregnancies',data=df)
plt.subplot(3,3,8)
sns.boxplot(x='DiabetesPedigreeFunction',data=df)
```

### The code above calculates the correlation matrix using df.corr(), which computes the pairwise correlation between all columns in the dataset. The resulting correlation matrix, corrmat, represents the strength and direction of the linear relationship between the features.

```python
corrmat=df.corr()
sns.heatmap(corrmat, annot=True)
```
- The sns.heatmap() function then visualizes the correlation matrix as a heatmap. Each cell in the heatmap represents the correlation between two features, with color indicating the strength of the correlation. The annot=True parameter enables the display of correlation values inside each cell.

- This heatmap is useful for identifying features that are strongly correlated (either positively or negatively). High positive correlation suggests that the features move in the same direction, while high negative correlation indicates they move in opposite directions. It helps to identify potential multicollinearity issues and provides insights into the interdependencies between features.

- The generated correlation heatmap helps in feature selection, identifying redundant features, and understanding the relationships among variables in the dataset.
