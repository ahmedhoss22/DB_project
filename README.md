# Diabetes Prediction

## Description
The Diabetes Prediction project aims to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the presence or absence of diabetes in individuals based on various clinical features. The project utilizes a dataset containing information such as glucose levels, blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), age, and other factors related to diabetes.

| Function              | Description                                          |

| df.corr()             | Computes the correlation matrix of a DataFrame `df`. |
| QuantileTransformer() |  function creates an instance of the QuantileTransformer class, which is a data transformation technique for mapping the features of a dataset to a specified distribution. |
| quantile.fit_transform(x)| method is a convenient way to fit the quantile transformer to the data x and apply the transformation in a single step. It combines the fit() and transform() methods into one operation. |
|GridSearchCV() | function is a powerful tool from scikit-learn used for hyperparameter tuning and model selection. It performs an exhaustive search over a specified parameter grid to find the best combination of hyperparameters for a given estimator. |
